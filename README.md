# Pi Collisions

This is a simulation of conservation of momentum. Because the bigger block is 100 <sup>(digits - 1)</sup> the math works out to calculate PI from the number of collision the smaller block encounters. Hitting the immovable wall at x == 0 and hitting the larger block is counted as a collision.
